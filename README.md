# Notes
1. The `legacy` dir is where I've stored an older version of this project. Back
   then, I was extremely motivated and challenged myself to both learn C++ and
   solve the book using it. That motivation did steadily die out, and so I
   archived that version of the project and went back to good ol' trusty simple
   Python. Relatable, ain't it?
